## Preamble:
This project primarily studies two datasets of SAT/ACT data.
My project statement involves providing action items to follow to lift SAT participation in the U.S.
The solution identifies the redesigned testing that is more aligned with current curricula and the cost savings as the key to growing market share in the testing market.  It also includes a list of 15 states in three tiers based on priority, to target as potential growth areas.  The tag line for the message is "Test to the Teaching."

## Summary of Results
The participation data helps to guide how far we can make inferences.  The aggregate data of scores are often not representative of the test-taker population due to low participation.  Our confidence interval calculations have been interpreted based on the limitations of collecting new data for a previous year.  There are some positive and negative correlations worth noting that make it difficult to make compare results of testing between the SAT and the ACT.
For our recommendation to the College Board, we highlight the success case in the state of Michigan which switched from requiring the ACT to requiring the SAT, at a great savings to the state's Board of Education.  Detailed action items include considering state population and credit-rating data to target states with high ACT-participation rates, low populations and relatively-low credit ratings.  We name five states (AR, MS, MT, ND and WY) in particular for lobbying Boards of Education.

## Remediation
The analytics now have titles and axis labels.
The notebook is more self-contained and is expected to run smoothly upon opening.
The inappropriate plots have been replaced.
Unsupported conclusions have been retracted.
The presentation deck reflects the new plots.
The responses to question prompts from #19 onwards have been revised.

### Thank you for reviewing this work.
