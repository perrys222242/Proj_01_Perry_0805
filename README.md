Preamble:
This project primarily studies two datasets of SAT/ACT data.
My project statement involves providing action items to follow to lift SAT participation in the U.S.
The solution identifies the redesigned testing that is more aligned with current curricula and the cost savings as the key to growing market share in the testing market.  It also includes a list of 15 states in three tiers based on priority, to target as potential growth areas.  The tag line for the message is "Test to the Teaching."

Thank you for reviewing this work.
